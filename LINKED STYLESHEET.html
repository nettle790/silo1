TEXT TRANSFORM

specifies how to capitalize a word first letter of every word.<br>
<p class="capitalize">capitalizes the first character in each word to uppercase.</p>

can make all uppercase or lowercase.

<p class="uppercase">this value transforms all characters grinder+bp to uppercase</p>
 same for lowercase.oli 7.5+lazy+smart.
 value <b>none</b> goes as is.<br>

 <p>LETTER-SPACING PROPERTY<br>
 specifies space between characters in a text.values are NORMAL..default with no extra space between characters.LENGTH...defines an extra space between characters using measurements units like px,pt,cm,mm,etc.INHERIT...inherits the property from its parent element.</p>

 <p class="normal">this para has no  additional letter spacing</p>
 <p class="positive">this para is letter spaced at 6px</p>
<p class="negative">this para is letter spaced at -1.5px</p>

<p>WORD_SPACING<br>
  same values as letter-spacing.
  <p class="normal">this word is not word spacing</p>
  <p class="px">this para is word spaced to 60px</p>

  <p>THE WHITE SPACE PROPERTY</p>
  specifies how white space inside in an element is handled.The values can be set as NORMAL,INHERIT,NOWRAP etc.

  <p>this para has    multiple spaces   and         a line break but it will be ignored as we have used the nowrap value.</p>
the text will continue on the same line until a <br> tag is encountered.chet bought stuff,consume, cause.bp.
<p>THE WHITE SPACE VALUES</p>
pre-text...text will only wrap on line breaks and white space.
pre-line...txt will wrap where there is a break in code but extra white space is still ignored.
pre-wrap....txt will wrap when necessary and on line breaks.
<p class="pre">
  in the markup we have multiple spaces and a line break.</p>
  <p class="preline">in the markup we have multiple    spaces.    and a line break,but in the result multiple spaces are ignored.</p>
  <p class="prewrap">
  in the markup we have multiple spaces and a line break.</p>


pre-wrap values behaves as the pre value except that it adds extra line breaks to prevent the text breaking out of the element box.

<p><font color="yellow">THE CSS BOX MODEL</p></font>

All htmll elements can be considered boxes..The CSS box model represents the design and layout of the site.it consists or margins,borders,paddings and the actual content.
The properties work in the same order.top,right,bottom and left.the term box model is used when talking about design and layout.

every element of the webpage is a box.css uses the box model to determine how big the boxes are and how to place them.

the box model is also used to calculate the actual width and height of the html elements.

<p><font color="yellow">TOTAL WIDTH OF AN ELEMENT</p></font><br>

when working with boxes it is important to understand how the total width of an element is calculated.

the total width of the box with paddings will be the sum of width plus padding left and padding right.

<table border="3"width="300"height="300"
cellpadding="50px"cellspacing="50"bordercolor="orange">
  <td>link</td><td>roll</td></table>

  
  Another box with margins,border and paddings.
  the total width is the <p class="underline">sum of left and right margins,left and right borders,left and right paddings and the actual width of the content</p>.
  When you set the width and height of the
properties of an element with css you set the width and height of the content area.Whe setting a background-color to a box  it covers the content area as well as the padding.

 <p><font color="yellow">TOTAL HEIGHT OF AN ELEMENT</p></font><br>

 Total element height=Height+top padding+bottom padding+top border+bottom border+top margin+bottom margin

 <p><font color="yellow">THE BORDER PROPERTY</font></p>
<p> In order to add a border to the element u must specify the size,style and color of the border.</p>

 <p>this is an example of a solid border</p>

 <p><font color="yellow">BORDER WIDTH</font></p>

 <p>width properties can be set seperately</p>
the border width property specifies th e width of the border</p>
<p class="third">border width of this para is set to 2px</p>
<p class="fourth">border width of this para is set to 5px</p>

<p><font color="yellow">BORDER STYLE</font></p>

the default value for border style is NONE.

<p class="none">this para has no border</p>
<p class="dotted">this para is dotted</p>
<p class="dashed">this para is dashed</p>
<p class="double">this para is double</p>
<p class="groove">this para is groove</p>
<p class="ridge">this para is ridge</p>
<p class="inset">this para is inset</p>
<p class="outset">this para is outset</p>
<p class="hidden">this para is hidden</p>

To style a <div> element to have a total width and height of 100px.</div>
the total width and height of the box will be 90px+5px(border)+5px(border)=100px<br>

<p>can also be assigned percents</p>
in the example below the <div>the total width of this element is
<strong>100%</strong>and the total height is <strong>100px</strong></div>

follow the div code but width in percent.

<p>MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM HEIGHT AND WIDTH OF AN ELEMENT</p>
min-width
min-height
max-width
max-height
<p class="first">the <strong>minimum height</strong>of this para is set to 100px</p>
<p class="second">the <strong>maximum width</strong>of this para set to 100px</p>

 <p><font color="yellow">BACKGROUND COLOR PROPERTY</font>></p>

 <p>the background color of this page is set to lightblue</p>

<p><font color="yellow">BACKGROUND COLOR VALUES</font>font></p>

the color of the background can be defined using three different formats:
color name,hexadecimal values and RGB

<h1>this is a heading</h1>
<p>this is a paragraph</p>

<p><font color="yellow">THE BACKGROUND-IMAGE property</font></p>
 sets one or several background images in an element.

 url specifies path to file.both relative and absolute paths are defined.

 Background-image can be set not only for the whole page but for individual elements as well.Below we set a background image for the <p>element.

  <p>this para has a background image<p>

  <p><font color="yellow">THE BACKGROUND-REPEAT PROPERTY</font></p>

  the background repeat property specifies how background images are repeated.a background image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis,both axes or not repeated at all.
  the repeat-x will repeat a background image only horizontally.

  <p><font color="yellow">THE BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT PROPERTY</font></p>
  the background attachment property sets whether a backgroung image is fixed or scrolls with the rest of the page.
  even if an element  has a scrolling mechanism a "fixed"background doesnt move with the element.

  <p><font color="yellow">THE BACKGROUND-ATTACHMENT VALUES</p></font>
   you can also set the background attachment to inherit or scroll.
   when you set the background attachment to scroll the background image will scroll with  the rest of the content.

   <p><font color="yellow">STYLING THE LISTS</p></font>
   The CSS list properties allow us to set different list item markers.In html there are two types of lists:
   unordered lists:<br>
   (<ul>)the list items are marked with bllets.
    ordered lists:<br>
    (<ol>)list items are marked with numbers or letters.<p>
     With Css lists can be styled further and images can be used as the list item marker.<br>
      one way is the list-style-type property which can be set to circle,square,decimal,disc,lower-alpha,etc.

<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>red</li>
<li>green</li>
<li>blue</li>
</ol>
<ul class="circle">
<li>red</li>
<li>green</li>
<li>blue</li>
</ul>
<ul clas="square">
<li>red</li>
<li>green</li>
<li>blue</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="yellow">THE LIST IMAGE AND POSITION</p></font>
there are also other list properties such as <br>
list-style-image----specifies an image to be used as the list item marker.

list-style-position---specifies the position of the marker box(inside,outside)

in the example below we use an image as the list item marker and specify the position to be inside of the content flow.

<p>the following list has list-style-position:<strong>inside</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>red</li>
  <li>green</li>
  <li>blue</li>
</ul>

"list-style-position outside"is the default value.

the list-style property is a shorthand property for setting list-style-type, list-style-image and list-style-position.it is used to set all of the list properties in one declaration.

<p><font color="yellow">THE TABLE PROPERTIES</p></font>

 the border-collapse property specifies whethet the table borders are collapsed into a single border  or seperated as default.if the borders are seperate the border-spacing property can be used to change the spacing.

 <table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>red</td>
    <td>green</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>blue</td>
    <td>yellow</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font color="yellow">THE CAPTION-SIDE PROPERTY</p></font>
this property specifies the position of a table caption.values can be set as TOP or BOTTOM

in the example below we specify the placement of a table caption to TOP

<table border="1">
  <caption>some of our courses</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>course name</th>
    <th>lessons</th>
    <th>quizzes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>c++</td>
    <td>81</td>
    <td>363</td>
  </tr>

    <p<font color="yellow">THE EMPTY CELLS PROPERTY</p></p<font>
    The empty cells property specifies whether or not to display borders and background on empty cells in a table.possible values are...

    show:the borders of an empty cells are rendered.
    hide:the borders are not drawn in empty celss.

here is the empty cells property that is used to hide borders of empty cellls in the table element.

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>html</td>
    <td>css</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>javascript</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><font color="yellow">THE TABLE LAYOUT PROPERTIES</p><br></font>

The table-layout specfies how the width of table columns is calculated, the possible values are:<br>

AUTO-when column or cell width are not explicitly set the column width will be in proportion to the amount of content in the cellls that make up the column.</br>

FIXED:when column or cell width are not explicitly set the column width will not be affected by the amount of content in the cellls that make up the column.</br>


the table layout is set to auto by default.
 the example below shows the difference  between auto and fixed.

 <p>table-layout is set to <strong>auto</strong></p>
 <table class="auto">
  <tr>
<td width="100%">500.000.000.000.000</td>
<td width="98%">20.000</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>table-layout is set to <strong>fixed</strong></p>
 <table class="fixed">
  <tr>
<td width="100%">500.000.000.000.000</td>
<td width="90%">20.000</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p><font color="yellow">SETTING STYLES TO LINKS</p></font><br>

LINKS can be styled with any css property(eg color,font-family,background,etc)
in addition links can be styled differently depending on what state they are in.The following pseudoselectors are available.<br>

a:link-defines the style for normal universal links.
a:visited-defines the style for visited links.
a:active-a link becomes active  once you click on it.
a:hover-a link is hovered when the mouse is over it.

the example below creates a link that will change the style when the mouse is moved over it.

<p><a href="http://www.sololearn.com"target="blank">
this link is hovered when we mouse over it</a></p>

<p><font color="yellow">LINKS TEXT DECORATION</p></font><br>

 By default text links are underlined by the browser.one of the most common uses of css with links is to remover the underline.in the example below the text-decoration property is used to remove the underline.

 <p><a href="http://www.sololearn.com"target="blank">
 this link has no underline.</a></p>
<SETTING THE MOUSE CURSOR STYLE>

CSS allows you to set your desired cursor style when you mouse over an element. For example, you can change your cursor into a hand icon, help icon, and much more, rather than using the default pointer. <br>

      <p><font color="yellow"  <SETTING THE MOUSE CURSOR STYLE></font></p></br>

 CSS allows you to set your desired cursor style when you mouse over an element. For example, you can change your cursor into a hand icon, help icon, and much more, rather than using the default pointer. <br>

 <p>In the example below, the mouse pointer is set to a help icon when we mouse over the span element:<br>

<p><font color="yellow"THE CURSOR PROPERTY VALUES<p></font></p><br>

There are numerous other possible values for the cursor property, such as:<br>
default - default cursor<br>
crosshair - cursor displays as crosshair<br>
pointer - cursor displays hand icon<br>

 <span style="cursor:help;">
    Do you need help?
 </span>

 <p><font color="yellow">THE CURSOR PROPERTY VALUES</font></p><br>

 There are numerous other possible values for the cursor property, such as:<br>
 default - default cursor<br>
 crosshair - cursor displays as crosshair<br>
 pointer - cursor displays hand icon<br>

 The list of possible values is quite long.

 <p>see list of cursor drawings in sololearn</p>

 <p>THE DEFAULT VALUE<p>
  Usually, the appearance of the mouse cursor is altered to provide a more interesting experience for website visitors. However, choosing the wrong cursor style can be misleading, as well.

 <p>For example, if the cursor value is set to default, users may not "see" the links.

 <p><font color="yellow">POSITIONING AND LAYOUT<p><br></font><br>
  <p>THE DISPLAY: BLOCK<p>

 <p>Every element on a web page is a rectangular box.The display property determines how that rectangular box behaves.<p><br>
 <p>A block element is an element that takes up the fullest width available, with line breaks before and after.</p><br>

 <p>The style rules in the following example display the inline <span> elements as block-level elements:</p>

 <span>the first para</span><br>
<span>the second para</span><br>

 <span>the third para</span><br>

 <span>the fourth para</span>

 <p>DISPLAY:INLINE</p>
 here only css.chek css.

result runs as a continous line.....the firstpara the second para etc.

<p>DISPLAY: NONE</p>
hides an element so it does not take up any space.the element will be hidden and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there.

<h1>this text will not display as we set the value to none.</h1>
<p>headline of this para is not displayed as we set the value to none.</p>

<p><font color="yellow">THE VISIBILITY PROPERTY</p></font></p><br>

<p>the visibility property specifies whether an element is visible or hidden.the most common values are visible and hidden.</p>

hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to "none"or the visibility property to "hidden".however notice that these two methods produce different results.

visibility:hidden hides an element but it will still take up the same space as before.the element will be hidden but it will still affect the layout.</p>


<h1>this is a heading </h1>
<div class="hidden">
  this text will not display in browser.</div>
  <p>
  the space above th is para is empty because the visibility of the div element is set to hidden</p>




<p><font color="yellow"POSITIONING<p></font></p><br>
The CSS positioning properties allow you to position an element. It can also place an element behind another, and specify what should happen when an element's content is too big.<br>
Elements can be positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the positioning method.<br>

<p>STATIC POSITIONING<p><br>

HTML elements are positioned static by default. A static positioned element is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
<p>para with no positioning<p>
<p>para with no positioning<p>
<p>para with no positioning<p>
<p>para with no positioning<p>
<p>para with no positioning<p>
<p class="position_static>this para has a static position</p

<p>FIXED POSITION<p><br>

An element with a fixed position is positioned relative to the browser window, and will not move even if the window is scrolled.
The position can be specified using one or more of the properties top, right, bottom, and left.
In the example below, the paragraph is fixed to 30px from the top and 5px from the right.
no html for above.

<p>RELATIVE POSITION<p><br>

A relative positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position.
The properties top, right, bottom, and left can be used to specify how the rendered box will be shifted.
no html for above.

<p><font color="yellow">FLOATING<br></p></font>

With CSS float, an element can be pushed to the left or right, allowing other elements to wrap around it.
Float is often used with images, but it is also useful when working with layouts.
The values for the float property are left, right, and none.
Left and right float elements in those directions, respectively. none (the default) ensures that the element will not float.
 Below is an example of an image that is floated to the right.

 <p><img src="css_logo.png"/>
 <p>this para has an image that is floated to the <strong>right</strong>.it is highly recommended to add a margin to the image so that the txt does not get close to the image.if u want ur txt to b easily read you must add a few pixels between words and borders,images and other content.
 <p>this para has an image that is floated to the <strong>right</strong>.it is highly recommended to add a margin
 to the image so that the txt does not get close to the image.<br>
 if u want ur txt to b easily read you must add a few pixels between words and borders,images and other content.

 <p><font color="yellow">ELEMENTS NEXT TO EACH OTHER</p></font><br>

 <p>if you place several floating elements one after the othert they will float next to each other if there is enough room.</p><br>

<p> as an example in a print layout images may be set  into the page such that text wraps aroung them as needed.</p><br>

 no html for above chek css.

 <p><font color="yellow">CLEARING THE FLOAT</p></font><br>

 elements that come after the floating element will flow around it. to avoid this use the clear property. the clear property specifies the sides of an element where other floating elements are not allowed to be.

 in the example below if we set the float property to the div,only the para that comes after the div will be wrapped around the image.

the html:

this para is above the div element and is not affected by the float right property.<br></br>
<div class="floating">
  <img src="css_logo.png">
</div>

this para comes after the div element and is affected by the float right property
.<br></br>

this para  also comes after the div element and is affected by the float right property.
<br></br>

<p>USING CLEAR</p>

use the values right,left and both to specify the sides of an element where other floating elements are not allowed to be.

the default value is none which allows floating elements on both the sides.

  the html:

  this para is above the div element and is not affected by the float right property.
  <br></br>
<div class="floating">
  <img src="css_logo.png">
</div>

no html for above.


this para comes after the div element and is affected by the float right property
</br><br class="clearing">


this para is out of the floating group
 and is not affected by the float right property.
<br></br>

<p><font color="yellow">THE OVERFLOW PROPERTY<p></font><br>

With CSS float, an element can be pushed to the left or right, allowing other elements to wrap around it.
Float is often used with images, but it is also useful when working with layouts.
The values for the float property are left, right, and none.
Left and right float elements in those directions, respectively. none (the default) ensures that the element will not float.
Below is an example of an image that is floated to the right.

As discussed earlier, every element on the page is a box. If the height of the box is not set, the height of that box will grow as large as necessary to accommodate the content.

the html:

<div>this text is inside the div element which has a blue background color and is floated to the left.we set a specific height and width for the div element and as u can see the content does not fit.</div>

As discussed earlier, every element on the page is a box. If the height of the box is not set, the height of that box will grow as large as necessary to accommodate the content.

<p><font color="yellow">THE OVERFLOW PROPERTY VALUES</p></font><br>

<div>this text is inside the div element which has a blue background color and is floated to the left.we set a specific height and width for the div element and as u can see the content does not fit.</div>

There are four values for the overflow property: visible (the default value), scroll, hidden, and auto.

The value scroll results in clipped overflow, but a scrollbar is added, so the rest of the content may be seen.


no html refer css.

<p>AUTO AND HIDDEN</p>

auto - If overflow is clipped, a scroll-bar should be added to make it possible to see the rest of the content.
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible.

no html refer css

<p>THE Z-INDEX PROPERTY</p>

when elements are positioned outside the normal flow they can overlap other elements.<br>
the z-index property specifies the stack order of an element ( which element should be placed in front of or behind the others)</p>

refer css

<p>assigning the z-index property</p>

assigning a higher z-index value to the blue div and a lower z-index value to the red div will result in the following:

refer css


    <p><font size="14"><align='center">CSS3</font></p></align><br>

latest standard for css,is completely backwards compatible with earlier css versions.<br>

significant features are:<br>

border radius---allows us to create rounded corners for elements<br>
border images----allows us to specify an image as the border around an element.<br>
multiple backgrounds-----applies multiple backgrounds to elements.
animations and effects.<br>

it introduces additional new features including:

box shadow---can attach one or more shadows to an element by specifying values for color,size,blur and offset.<br>

Gradients
 allow us to set the background color of the element to a gradient.Two types of gradient are available;linear and radial.most have been implemented.<br>


    <p><font size="14"><align='center">CSS Vendor Prefixes</font></p></align><br>

    are a way for browser makers to add support for new css features during perioss of testing and experimentation .browser prefixes are used to add new features that may not be a part of the final and formal css specification.<br>

    for example, the prefix for safari and chrome is -webkit.the border- radius property is currently supported in chrome, safari,and mozilla as long as it is accompanied by the browser prefix.<br>

    the prefix is added to the property to make it work in the unsupported browsers. so u might end up with multiple definitions fo the same property each with the specific browser prefix.<br>

    while most browsers today will work without prefixes it is essential to know these for backwards capability and understanding older codes.
    pbren-75mg-tightens. <br>

    <p><font color="yellow"BROWSER PREFIXES</p></font><br>

    list:
<ol>
  <li>firefox....-moz-
    <li>safari...-webkit-
      <li>chrome...-webkit-
      <li>opera...-o-
        <li>internet explorer.....-ms</li></ol><br>

it might be repetitive to have to write the properties 2-5 times to get them to work in all browsers but its temporary.as browsers improve they add support for the standards based version of the properties, and u can remove the prefixed versions.

     <p><font color="yellow">ROUNDED CORNERS</p><br></font>

  with CSS3 you can give any element "rounded corners" by using the border-radius property.

       <p>CREATING A CIRCLE</p>

  a rectangle can be turned into a circle only in css.
  to create a circle the border radius should be half of the height and width.<br>

  the rectangle in the example below has a width and height of 200px.by setting the border radius to 100px,the corners will be rounded to form a circle.


       <p><font color="yellow"THE BOX-SHADOW PROPERTY</p></font><br>

The CSS3 box-shadow property applies shadow to elements.

components of the box-shadow property are decoded by browsers in the foll manner:<br>

the first length for the horizontal offset will cast the shadow to the right of the box.<br>

the second length for the vertical offset will cast the shadow to below the box.<br>

In the example the horizontal and vertical offsets have been set to 10px:<br>

           refer css<br>


      <p>BLUR AND SPREAD</p>

Besides color there are also two optional values for the box-shadow element which are blur and spread.<p>
the blur and spread values should be used before the color value.

        <p>NEGATIVE VALUES</p>

negative values can also be used for the box-shadow property.<br>

horizontal offset-the shadow will be to the left of the box.<br>.
vertical offset-the shadow will be above the box.<br>
blur radius-negative values are not allowed.<br>
spread radius-negative values will cause the shadow to shrink.

          <p><font color="yellow">TRANSPARENCY EFFECT</p><br></font><br>


before css3 transparent background images were used to create transparency effects. the new features of css3 now make it easier to create transparency effects.

css supports color names,hexadecimal and rgb colors.
in addition the css3 introduces the foll:

RGBA colors<br>

RGBA color values are an extension of rgb color values with an alpha channel which specifies the opacity for a color.

an rgba color value is specified with rgba(red,green,blue,alpha).the alpha parameteris a number between 0.0(fully transparent)and 1.0(fullly opaque).<br>

HSL(hue,satuuration,lightness)colors:<br>

an hsl color value is specified with hsl(hue,satuuration,lightness)


          <p><font color="yellow"THE TEXT-SHADOW PROPERTY</p></font><br>

defines one or more comma-seperated shadow effects to be applied to the text content of the current element.the image below shows how the text-shadow property is applied.

     text-shadow  0px      5px        3px    #355

                                      blur
                 x-offset
                           y-offset
                                              color


the offset-x and offset-y values are required for the css text-shadow property.<br>

the color value is not required but since the default for the text-shadow is transparent, the text-shadow will not appear unless you specify a color value.


      <p><font color="yellow"WORKING WITH PSEUDO CLASSES</p></font><br>

the css pseudo-classes allow us to style elements or parts of elements that exist in the document tree without using javascript or any other scripta. a pseudo -class starts with a ":".<br>

the most commonly used pseudo-classes are:
:first-ch<br>
:last-ch<br>

the :first-ch pseudo-class matches an element that is the first ch element of some other element.<br>

in the following example the selector matches any <p>element that is the first ch of the div element:<br>

              <p>html</p>

<div id="parent">
  <p>first para</p>
  <p>second para</p>
  <p>third para</p>
  <p>fourth para</p>
</div>

the :last-ch pseudo-class matches an element that is the last ch element of some other element.<br>

in the example below the selector will match any <p>element that is the last ch of the div element:<br>
 refer css

 <p><font color="yellow">WORKING WITH PSEUDO-ELEMENTS</p><br></font><br>

 pseudo elements are used to select specific parts of an element.<br>
 there are five pseudo elements in css,each starting with a double colon(::):

::first-line-the first line of the text in a selector.<br>
::first-letter-the first letter of the text in a selector.<br>
::selection-selects the portion of an element that is selected by a user.<br>
::before-inserts some content before an element.<br>
::after-inserts some content after an element.

in the example below, the ::first-line pseudo element is used to style the first line of our text:


         <p><font color="yellow">THE WORD WRAP PROPERTY</p></font><br>

the word-wrap property allows long words to be broken and wrapped into the next line.it takes two values:
NORMAL<br>
BREAK-WORD<br>

In the example below,the word-wrap property is set to normal.refer css.the words go out of the container.<br>

now let us see what happens when we set it to break-word.refer css.here the words are contained with the container as the words are broken.<br>

          <p><font color="yellow">THE @FONT-FACE RULE</p></font><br>

The @font-face rule allows custom fonts to be loaded into the webpage.<br>

with the help of this rule,designs are no longer limited to the fonts that are installed on a users computer.<br>

in internet explorer 8 and earlier the url must point to an embedded OpenType(eot)file while firefox, chrome, etc support truetype fonts(ttf)and OpenType fonts(otf).<br>

firefox               .ttf,.otf
safari                .ttf,.otf
chrome                .ttf,.otf
opera                 .ttf,.otf
internet explorer     .eot

in the @font-face rule u must first define a name for the font(e.g myFirstFont)and then point to the font file.

        <p><font color="yellow">USING THE @font-face rule</p></font><br>

  each form of the font family must be declared using the @font-face rule.in the example below, a custom font called "delicious"is loaded and used for the heading.<br>

  HTML<br>

  <h1>this is our headline</h1><br>

  internet explorer has a built-in bug when multiple @font-face rules are defined.using #iefix as shown below fixes the problem.refer css.<br>

the question mark fools IE into thinking  the rest of the string is a query string  and loads just the EOT file. the other browsers follow the spec and select the format they neeed based on the src cascade.<br>

        <p><font color="yellow">GRADIENTS AND BACKGROUNDS<p></font>

     CREATING LINEAR GRADIENTS <br>

CSS3 gradients enable you to display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors. CSS3 defines two types of gradients: Linear and Radial.

To create a linear gradient, you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors among which you want to render smooth transitions. You can also set a starting point and a direction - or an angle - along with the gradient effect.<br>

In the example below, the colors blue and black are used to create a linear gradient from top to bottom.<br>refer css.


You can use color names, Hex values, RGB, or HSL colors to define the gradient color.

          <p><font color="yellow">COLOR STOPS</p></font><br>

Colors can be added one after the other, separated with a comma. The browser will then determine each color stop position.<br>

	In the example below, the linear gradient has multiple color stops and runs from top to bottom.<br>refer css.<br>

	Color stop positions can be specified for each color.refer css<br>

	<p>In addition to percentages, you can also use px, em, and so on, to specify the color stops.
	If you use the same color stop position for two colors, a sharp line will be created between them.<p>

	        <p>DiRECTION OF THE GRADIENT</p>

	The direction of the gradient can be changed.
	In the example below, the first gradient starts at left, moving right; the second one runs from bottom to top.refer css.<br>

		left, right, top, and bottom are supported values for the gradient direction. You can also use their various combinations to specify direction (e.g., bottom right)<br>

	       <p>Angle of the gradient</p>

		 As an alternative to predefined directions (bottom, top, right, left, bottom right, etc.), you can control the gradient's direction by specifying an angle.<br>

		 The angle is specified as an angle extending between a horizontal line and the gradient line. In other words, 0deg creates a left-to right-gradient, while 90deg generates a bottom-to-top gradient.<br>


		 <p>REPEATING A LINEAR GRADIENT<p>

			 The repeating-linear-gradient() function is used to repeat a linear gradient:

			 <p><font color="yellow">Radial Gradient</p></font><br>

		<p><font color="yellow">RADIAL GRADIENT<p></font>

		To create a radial gradient, you must define at least two color stops.
			 The radial gradient is defined by its center.<br>

			css syntax:
		background: radial gradient(position,shape or size,color-stops);

				 <br>
		 The first value defines the gradient position. We can use a descriptive keyword, such as top, bottom, center, or left; or we can specify, for example, 50% 50% to set the gradient at the center or 0% 0% to set the gradient to start at top left.<br>

		 The second value defines the shape and the gradient size. There are two arguments to shape gradients: The first is the ellipse, which is the default; and the second is the  circle.<br>

		 lastly the third value defines the color-combination.<br>

		 <p>SETTING THE SHAPES</p><br>

		 The shape parameter defines the shape. If you do not define the shape of the radial gradient, it will take the ellipse value by default.<br>

In the example below, we didn't specify the shape of the first divâ€™s radial gradient, but for the second, we set the value to circle.
Here is what happened:refer css<br>

<p>RADIAL GRADIENT POSITION</p><br>

Essentially, we can use the same method used to specify the location of a background image with the background-position CSS property to specify the location of the ellipseâ€™s center. We specify the horizontal position of the background, and - optionally - the vertical position using either keywords (left, center right, or top, center, bottom), length values, percentage values, or some combination of these. <br>

In the example below, the first gradient starts from the top left corner; in the second, we set 5% to the green, 15 % to the yellow and 60% to the blue.<br>

In addition to percentages, you can use pixels or ems.<br>

<p>SETTING THE COLOR STOPS</p><br>

As with linear gradients, a color stop is specified with a color, plus an optional stop position, which is a length or percentage value.<br>


<p><font color="yellow">THE BACKGROUND SIZE PROPERTY</p></font><br>

<p>The background-size property adds new functionality to CSS that allows us to specify the size of background images, using either lengths or percentages. <br>

The current versions of most popular browsers - including Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Opera - now support background-size, without the need for vendor prefixes.<br></p>

<p><<font color="yellow">THE BACKGROUND-SIZE VALUES</p></font><br>

The two other possible values for background size are the keywords contain and cover. <br>

<p><font color="yellow">THE BACKGROUND SIZE PROPERTY</p></font><br>

<p>The background-size property adds new functionality to CSS that allows us to specify the size of background images, using either lengths or percentages.

The current versions of most popular browsers - including Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Opera - now support background-size, without the need for vendor prefixes.</p>

<p><<font color="yellow">THE BACKGROUND-SIZE VALUES</p></font><br>

<p>The two other possible values for background size are the keywords contain and cover.

The contain keyword scales the image so that it fits the container.
In other words, the image will grow or shrink proportionally, but the width and height will not exceed the container's dimensions:<br>

<p>css syntax:<br>

background-size: contain;<br></p>

background-size also accepts the cover keyword. The image is scaled to fit the entire container; however, if that has a different aspect ratio, the image will be cropped:

 <p>css syntax<br>

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
background-size: cover;<p><br>

<p><font color="yellow">THE BACKGROUND-CLIP PROPERTY</p></font><br>

<p>The background-clip property specifies the painting area of the background.
=======
background-size: cover;</p>

<p><font color="yellow">THE BACKGROUND-CLIP PROPERTY</p></font><br>

The background-clip property specifies the painting area of the background.<br>
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

The property takes three different values:

border-box - (default) the background is painted to the outside edge of the border<br>
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

padding-box - the background is painted to the outside edge of the padding
content-box - the background is painted within the content box<br>

In the example below, the first div with background-clip is set to padding-box; in the second div it's set to content-box.</p><br>

<p><font color="yellow">BACKGROUND-CLIP WITH IMAGES</p></font><br>

		 background-clip also applies to background images.<br>

		 <p>MULTIPLE BACKGROUND</p><br>

<p>The ability to have multiple background images is a new feature in CSS3.

Multiple background images are specified using a comma-separated list of values for the background-image property. The first image will appear on the top, the last on the bottom.

In the example below, we have two background images: the first is a CSS logo (aligned to the bottom and right); the second is a coding image (aligned to the top-left corner).</p><br>

<p>MULTIPLE BG POSITION</p><br>

<p>The position of the background images can be changed, using the background-position property.

Multiple backgrounds can also be specified using the background: shorthand property. refer css</p>


<p><font color="yellow">THE OPACITY PROPERTY</p></font><br>

<p>CSS opacity property provides an excellent means of adding opacity to any element.<br>

In the example below, we set different levels of opacity to the same picture, so you can clearly see the difference.<br>

The opacity property value must be a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).</p><br>

<p>OPACITY IN INTERNET EXPLORER</p><br>

<p>To have the opacity property work in all versions of IE, use the filter:alpha(opacity=x) along with the opacity property. x can take a value from 0 to 100.

The value 0 results in a completely transparent element (i.e., 100% transparent), whereas the value 100 makes the element completely opaque (i.e., 0% transparent).<br>

For example, in order to have the code work properly with IE, when the opacity of the image is set at 0.5, it should look like this:<br>

The alpha filter is a Microsoft-only property, not a standard CSS property.</p><br>


    <p><font color="yellow">CSS TRANSITIONS</p><br></font>

<p>	CSS3 transitions allow us to change from one property value to another over a given duration.

transition-property - specifies the property to be transitioned<br>

transition-duration - specifies the duration over which transitions should occur<br>

transition-timing-function - specifies how the pace of the transition changes over its duration<br>

transition-delay - specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect<br>

In the example below, we set the transition property to transform, with a duration of 5 seconds, and with an ease-in timing function that specifies a transition effect with a slow start.
refer css.<br>

Transition effects can be applied to a wide variety of CSS properties, including background-color, width, height, opacity, and many more.</p><br>

<p><font color="yellow">THE TRANSITION PROPERTY</p><br></font>

In the example below, the div element has width and height of 50px, with a green background. We specified a transition effect for the width property, with a duration of 3 seconds:<br>

<p>TRANSITION -TIMING FUNCTION</p><br>

<p>The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.<br>

It can have the following values:<br>

ease - the animation starts slowly, then accelerates quickly.<br>

ease-in - starts slowly, then accelerates, and stops abruptly.<br>

ease-out - starts quickly, but decelerates to a stop.<br>

ease-in-out - similar to ease, but with more subtle acceleration and deceleration.<br>

linear - constant speed throughout the animation; often best for color or opacity changes.<br>

Finally, we have cubic-bezier(), which allows you to define your own values in the cubic-bezier function. Possible values are numeric values from 0 to 1.</p><br>


<p><font color="yellow">CSS3 TRANSFORMS</p><br></font>


<p>CSS3 transforms allow you to translate, rotate, scale, and skew elements.<br>

A transformation is an effect that lets an element change shape, size, and position.<br>

CSS3 supports 2D and 3D transformations. Let's take a look at the rotate transformation:<br></p>


<p>USING NEGATIVE VALUES</p><br>

As previously mentioned, using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counter-clockwise.


<p>TRANSFORM-ORIGIN</p><br>

<p>The transform-origin property allows you to change the position of transformed elements. The default value for the property is 50% 50%, which corresponds to the center of the element.<br>

In the example below, we use the transform-origin property together with transform-rotate. The origin of the x-axis (horizontal) is set to 25% from the left. The origin for the y-axis (vertical) is set to 75% from above.<br>

0 0 is the same value as top left, and 100% 100% is the same value as bottom right.<br>


The transform-origin property must be used together with the transform property.<br></p>


   <p><font color="yellow">THE TRANSLATE()METHOD<p><br></font>

<p>	The translate() method moves an element from its current position (according to the parameters given for the x-axis and the y-axis). Positive values will push an element down and to the right of its default position, while negative values will pull an element up and to the left of its default position.<br>

		In this example below, the div element is moved 100px to the right and 50px down:<br>

		An element can also be moved by setting the margins or by positioning the element, although translate is a better choice for animating elements.<br></p>

		<p><font color="yellow">THE SKEW()METHOD<p><br></p>

		<p>The skew() method skews an element along the x-axis and the y-axis by the given angles.<br>

			The following example skews the <div> element by 30 degrees along the X-axis:<br>

			If the second parameter is not specified, it has a zero value.</p><br>


			<p><font color="yellow">THE SCALE METHOD<p><br></font>

	<p>The scale() method increases or decreases the size of an element, according to the parameters given for the width and height. 1 stands for the original size, 2 for twice the original size, and so on. <br>

		In the example below, we decreased the first div by the factor 0.7 both horizontally and vertically, and increased the second div by a factor of 1.5 horizontally and vertically.<br>

	If only one parameter is passed to the scale() method, it will apply that factor for both the height and the width.<br></p>


			<p><font color="yellow">MULTIPLE TRANSFORMS</p></font>

	<p>	Multiple transforms can be used at once. Rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time is an example of that.refer css.

		Applying multiple transforms to an element is simple; just separate them using spaces.

		If you use commas to separate the functions, none of the functions will be applied, so keep in mind not to use commas.</p><br>

	<p><font color="yellow">CSS3 ANIMATIONS</p></font>

	<p>An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
You can change as many CSS properties as you want to, as many times you want to.
Keyframes hold the styles the element will have at certain times.</p><br>

<p>THE @KEYFRAMES RULE</p><br>

<p>When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.<br>

To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.<br>


The following example will change the background color of an element three times: when the animation is 50% complete, 70% complete, and when the animation is 100% complete.refer css.<br></p>

<p>THE @KEYFRAMES RULE</p>

<p>As an alternative to using percentages, you can use from and to keywords, where:<br>

from is a starting offset of 0%<br>

to is an ending offset of 100%.

The two examples below are equivalent, and produce the same result:refer css for both examples.</p><br>

<p>THE @KEYFRAMES RULE</p>

	<p>To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.<br>

	In the example below, the animation lasts one second, and changes the background color of the red div to green and blue.<br></p>


	<p><font color="yellow">THE ANIMATION NAME PROPERTY</p></font>

		<p>animation-name property defines which animation to use.<br>

		In this example, the name of the animation is set to colorchange, which matches the defined keyframes.<br>

		refer css for more details

	<p>ANIMATION PROPERTIES</p>

	<p>The animation-timing-function specifies the speed curve of an animation. It can have the following values:<br>

ease - specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)<br>

linear - specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end<br>

ease-in - specifies an animation with a slow start<br>

ease-out - specifies an animation with a slow end.<br>

ease-in-out-specifies an animation with a slow start and end.<br>

cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function.refer css.<br></p>


<p>The animation-iteration-count</p>

<p>The animation-iteration-count property determines the number of times an animation repeats.<br>

	To make the animation repeat forever, just use the infinite value:</p><br>

	<p><font color="yellow">3D TRANSFORMS</p></font>

	<p>Along with the x and y axes, 3D Transforms introduce the Z-axis, which enables 3D manipulations.
3D Transforms are quite similar to 2D Transforms:
rotateX(), rotateY() and rotateZ() rotate an element in 3D space around the corresponding axis at a given degree.<br>

	You can switch off all transformations applied to an element using the none function: transform: none;</p><br>

	<p>TRANSLATIONS</p>

<p>	3D translate methods allow you to move the element horizontally (translateX), vertically (translateY) and into or out of the screen (translateZ), using any CSS length units (px, em, %, etc.). Positive values moves the element toward the viewer, negative values away.<br>


	The translate3d() method allows us to pass the x, y, and z offsets, all at once and in the following order:<br>

		Like the translate3d() method, there are also scale3d() and rotate3d(), which are applicable for scaling and rotating elements in 3D.<br>

		Translation of an element is similar to relative positioning - it doesn't affect the document's flow. The translated element will keep its position in the flow and will only appear to have moved.<br></p>

		<p><font color="yellow">PERSPECTIVE</p></font>

		<p>Perspective defines how the depth of the 3D scene is rendered. Think of perspective as a distance from the viewer to the object. The greater the value, the further the distance, so the less intense the visual effect.<br>

		When defining the perspective property for an element, it is the child elements that get the perspective view, not the element itself.<br>

		The perspective property only affects 3D transformed elements.<br></p>


		<p><font color="yellow">CSS FILTERS</p></font>

	<p>The CSS filter property lets you apply graphical effects like blurring or color shifting to an element. <br>

Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.<br>

Image filtering is useful when you want to have different styling for the same image. <br>

Instead of uploading multiple images to the website, you can upload only one image and then define visual effects using the filter property.<br>

Filter functions include blur(), brightness(), contrast(), drop-shadow(), grayscale(), hue-rotate(), invert(), opacity(), saturate() and sepia().<br>

Tap Continue to explore the filters and see them in action!

The filter property is not supported in Internet Explorer, Edge 12, Safari 5.1 and earlier.<br></p>

<p><font color="yellow">THE DROPSHADOW FUNCTION</p></font>

drop-shadow(w h b c) creates a shadow effect that extends beyond an image for the width w and height h with blur b and color c.
w, h, and b are values in pixels.

Positive values create the shadow to the right and below the image.
Negative width and height values create the shadow above and to the left of the image.

<p>THE GRAYSCALE FUNCTION</p>

<p>The grayscale function converts an image to grayscale. <br>

The only parameter defines the proportion of the conversion. <br>

0% grayscale is the original image, whereas 100% makes the image completely grayscale.<br>

Here is an example using a percentage value to make an image completely grayscale:<br>

Any negative value leaves the image unchanged.<br></p>

<p><font color="yellow">THE SEPIA FUNCTION</p></font>

<p>The sepia function converts an image to sepia.<br>

This is similar to using grayscale but with a reddish-brown color tone.

The idea behind sepia filters is that they can make black and white photos look a bit more eye-catching than the basic grayscale version. <br>

0% sepia is the original image, whereas 100% converts the image to sepia completely:<br></p>


<p><font color="yellow">THE SATURATE FUNCTION</p></font>

<p>The saturate function controls the color saturation for an image. The only parameter determines the proportion of the saturation that is applied to the image.

The parameter can be either a percentage value or a number.

0% creates a completely unsaturated image (grayscale), whereas 100% is the original image.<br></p>

<p><font color="yellow">THE HUE-ROTATE FUNCTION</p></font>

<p>The hue-rotate function applies a hue rotation (based on the color circle) to an image. <br>

The function takes an angle of rotation as its parameter. The value of angle defines the number of degrees around the color circle the input samples will be adjusted.<br>

When you use hue-rotate() to rotate the hue, you are rotating around this color circle.<br>

If the image contains red color, which is at 0 degrees on the color circle, rotating the hue by 240deg will make the red color blue.<br>

0 and 360deg rotations leave the image unchanged.<br>

<p><font color="yellow">THE INVERT FUNCTION</p></font>

<p>The invert function inverts the colors of an image to make dark areas bright and bright areas dark.
The function takes the proportion of the conversion as its parameter.

The parameter can be either a percentage value or a number. <br>

0% invert leaves the image unchanged, whereas 100% creates a completely inverted image that is similar to a photographic negative.<br>

Here is an example using a percentage value to make the image partially inverted:<br>

The specification allows values over 100%, but that will have no further effect on the image.<br></p>

<p><font color="yellow">THE OPACITY FUNCTION</p></font>

<p>The opacity function sets the opacity of an image to change its transparency.<br>

0% opacity creates a completely transparent image, whereas 100% is the original image.<br></p>

<p><font color="yellow">THE BRIGHTNESS FUNCTION</p></font>

<p>The brightness(amount) function adjusts the brightness of an image, making it appear brighter or darker.<br>

The amount parameter determines the brightness level of the image. The parameter can take either a percentage value or a number. <br>

A value of 0% results in an image that is completely black.<br>

A value of 100% results in an image that is unchanged. <br>

Any amount over 100% produces a brighter image.<br>

A value under 100% darkens the image, while a value over 100% brightens it.<br>

A number value of 0.5 has the same effect as the percentage value of 50%. A value of 1 is the same as 100%.<br></p>


<p><font color="yellow">THE CONTRAST FUNCTION</p></font>

<p>The contrast function adjusts the contrast of the image.
The amount parameter can take either a percentage value or a number. <br>

A value under 100% decreases the contrast, while a value over 100% increases it. <br>

A value of 0% will create an image that is completely gray, while a value of 100% leaves the image unchanged. <br>

The value 0.5 corresponds to 50%, while 1 is the same as 100%.</p><br>

<p><font color="yellow">THE BLUR FUNCTION</p></font>

<p>The blur function applies a blur effect to an image. <br>

The blur function has only one parameter, radius, which defines how many pixels on the screen blend into each other. (a larger value creates more blur).<br></p>

<p><font color="yellow">MULTIPLE CSS FILTERS</p></font>

<p>Multiple CSS filters can be used together by separating them with spaces.<br>

The following code demonstrates the use of the blur and the hue-rotate functions:







=======
padding-box - the background is painted to the outside edge of the padding<br>
content-box - the background is painted within the content box

<p><font color="yellow">BACKGROUND-CLIP WITH IMAGES</p></font><br>

		 background-clip also applies to background images.

     <p>TRANSPARENT BORDERS WITH BACKGROUND-CLIP</p>

setting a transparent border on an element will reveal the elements own background under the border<br>
in the example below we set the borders to be transparent using RGBA,but they acutally appear solid gray.<br>

by setting the background-clip property to padding-box the borders will be made transparent.refer second example.<br>

Transparency effect is achieved with the background -clip :padding-box.with out it the background of the box also goes beneath the borders making it non-transparent.<br>
